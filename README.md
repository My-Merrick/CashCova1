# How to Stake on the Crypto Trading Chart

1. Observe the Chart:

   - Watch the moving line on the chart. This represents the current price of the cryptocurrency.
   - Green segments indicate price increases, while red segments indicate decreases.

2. Check Your Balance:

   - Your current balance is displayed below the chart.
   - Ensure you have sufficient funds to place a stake.

3. Place a Stake:

   - Enter the amount you wish to stake in the input field.
   - Choose your prediction:
     - Click "Buy" if you think the price will go up.
     - Click "Sell" if you think the price will go down.

4. Active Stake:

   - Once you've placed a stake, you'll see an "Active stake" message showing your stake details.
   - The stake will be active for 1 minute.

5. Wait for the Result:

   - The chart will continue to move for 1 minute after your stake is placed.
   - Do not refresh the page or navigate away during this time.

6. Understand the Outcome:

   - After 1 minute, your stake will be settled automatically.
   - You'll see a "Stake Result" section appear with the following information:
     - Initial Stake: The amount you staked
     - Profit/Loss: How much you gained or lost
     - Total Return: Your initial stake plus or minus your profit/loss

7. Winning and Losing:

   - If you chose "Buy" and the price went up, you win.
   - If you chose "Buy" and the price went down, you lose.
   - If you chose "Sell" and the price went down, you win.
   - If you chose "Sell" and the price went up, you lose.
   - The amount you win or lose depends on how much the price changed.

8. Your New Balance:
   - After the stake is settled, your balance will be updated automatically.
   - If you won, your balance will increase.
   - If you lost, your balance will decrease.

Remember:

- Only stake what you can afford to lose.
- The crypto market is highly volatile and unpredictable.
- This is a simulated environment for educational purposes. Real trading carries significant risks.
